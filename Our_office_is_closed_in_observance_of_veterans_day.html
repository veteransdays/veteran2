        <p>The Veterans Day National Ceremony is held each year on <b>November</b> <b>11th</b> at Arlington National Cemetery . The ceremony commences precisely at 11:00 a.m. with a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknowns and continues inside the Memorial Amphitheater with a parade of colors by Veterans&rsquo; organizations and remarks from dignitaries.  <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b> is not about the <b>veteran</b> or the active-duty soldier &mdash; it is about the men and women buried across this nation in countless veteran and local cemeteries. They are not faceless, they are our friends, and fathers, sons and daughters &mdash; and we miss them.  <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b>, which took shape after the Civil War, is considered a day to honor those who were killed in or as a result of participating in battle.

Both <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> and <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b> honor the U.S. military community, but the two holidays serve different purposes &mdash; and their origins are rooted in two different wars.

Don&rsquo;t embarrass yourself: Know the difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day.  For many, <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is an extra Monday off before the holiday season gets into full swing, and <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b> is the weekend that signifies the start of summer. But both days have a significant ...  Unlike Memorial <b>Day</b>, <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> pays tribute to all American veterans&mdash;living or dead&mdash;but especially gives thanks to living veterans who served their country honorably during war or...  Many people confuse <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b> and <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>. Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. </p>        <p>Kohls veterans day sale 2024. <a href="./437.html">Veterans day artwork</a>.

        <p>The poppy has a long association with Remembrance <b>Day</b>. But how did the distinctive red flower become such a potent symbol of our remembrance of the sacrifices made in past wars?  Americans don&rsquo;t typically wear poppies on November 11 (<b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>), which honors all living <b>veterans</b>. Instead, they wear the symbolic red flower on Memorial <b>Day</b>&mdash;the last Monday in May&mdash;to...  <b>This</b> <b>May</b> <b>25th</b> is National Poppy Day, a day rich in meaning for veterans and service members across the United States. How did the poppy flower come to symbolize the sacrifices of veterans? The widespread use of the poppy flower to commemorate veterans began in World War I.  Known as the &ldquo;<b>Poppy</b> <b>Campaign</b>,&rdquo; veterans groups around the world have adopted the sale of the poppy to raise funds and recognition for Veterans and their family. In 1920, the American Legion adopted the Flanders Fields Memorial Poppy as the U.S. national emblem of Remembrance.  <b>The </b>red <b>poppy is </b>a symbol of sacrifice in honor of <b>the </b>soldiers that served and died for our country. Learn more about <b>the </b>origin of <b>the </b>red <b>poppy </b>and <b>how </b>wearing it for Memorial <b>Day </b>reflects our support for all <b>the </b>brave men and women for that made <b>the </b>ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

She mounted a long campaign that led the American Legion to adopt the red poppy in 1920 as its symbol of remembrance. McCrae did not live to see all this.  A remembrance <b>poppy</b> is an artificial flower worn in some countries to commemorate their military personnel who died in war. Remembrance poppies are produced by <b>veterans</b> &#39; associations, which exchange the poppies for charitable donations used to give financial, social and emotional support to members and <b>veterans</b> of the armed forces. [1]  It &quot;became a rallying cry to all who fought in the First World War,&quot; according to the U.S. Department of <b>Veterans</b> Affairs, and was read at memorial ceremonies. The red <b>poppy</b> became known as the ...  The restoration of the observance of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to November 11 not only preserves the historical significance of the date, but helps focus attention on the important purpose of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>: A celebration to honor America&rsquo;s <b>veterans</b> for their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good. </p>        <p>Veterans day celebration 9 nov.

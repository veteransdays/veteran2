        <p><b>1968</b>: <b>The</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>Holiday</b> <b>Act</b>: The law moved the celebration of Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October to create more three-day weekends for federal employees. However,...  In 1968, the Uniform Holidays Bill was passed by Congress, which moved the <b>celebration</b> of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to the fourth Monday <b>in October</b>.  A 1968 law moved the observance of the holiday to the fourth Monday <b>in October</b>, but that was unpopular, and in 1975, President Gerald Ford signed a law moving it back to Nov. 11.

The <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> National Ceremony, like most ceremonies around the nation, is held on <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> itself.  Unlike Memorial <b>Day</b>, which is an older holiday dating back to 1868 and specifically honors those who died in service, <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> celebrates all U.S. military <b>veterans</b>, living and deceased.  <b>Veterans</b> Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed annually on November 11, for honoring military veterans of the United States Armed Forces.
